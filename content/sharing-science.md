# Sharing Serious Science

The best part about science is the ability to build upon other people's work. Especially if other people's work implies that buying bananas makes people crave the madness of the Python import system.[^import] For example, see @fig:important-policy for a shareable figure.

:::{figure} #cell:correlation
:label: fig:important-policy

A very important correlation that all governments should pay serious policy attention to.

Of course, sometimes this really is _other_ people's work, rather than a _spurious correlation_, e.g. [this figure](xref:twcf2755#fig2) taken from SciPy's 2024 Proceedings:
:::{embed} #xref:twcf2755#fig2

[^import]: The joke here is that the Python import system is powerful. Perhaps _too_ powerful... The PSF should be stopped!
